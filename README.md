ðŸŽ¨ Exciting Update: A Random Color Palette Generator Project! ðŸš€

Today marks 64/100 of my coding journey, and I'm thrilled to share a project that I've been working on - a Random Color Palette Generator! ðŸŒˆ

Creating this color palette generator has been an incredible way to enhance my web development skills. It's not just a fun project but also a fantastic opportunity to grasp essential concepts like manipulating the DOM, working with loops, handling events, and designing user-friendly interfaces.

In this journey, I've documented the process of creating the generator in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can simply click the "Refresh Palette" button to generate a new set of random colors along with their hex color codes. The hex codes can be easily copied by clicking on the corresponding color card.

If you're curious to see how it looks and works, check out the live demo here.

Here's a quick overview of the steps I followed:

Create a folder: Name it as you prefer, and inside, add the necessary files.
index.html: Set up the basic layout of the project. The "ul" container will be populated with "li" elements representing colors using JavaScript.
style.css: Add styles to make your color palette visually appealing.
script.js: Implement the logic to generate random colors and handle user interactions.
The beauty of coding lies in experimentation. Feel free to tweak the code and make it even more useful for your projects. If you're interested in the nitty-gritty details, you can find the step-by-step guide in my latest blog post.
